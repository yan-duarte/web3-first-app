# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

Need to create a file named 'hadhat.config.js' and put the code below:

```typescript
require('@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle');

module.exports = {
  solidity: '0.8.0',
  networks: {
    ropsten: {
      url: 'https://eth-ropsten.alchemyapi.io/v2/D8SZUzEDOQqR-cjxQ6zLcdlfKDCs07Po',
      accounts: ['YOUR ACCOUNT INFORMATION']
    }
  }
}
```
